# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Algorithms repository! This repository contains implementations of various machine-learning algorithms using Python. Each algorithm is organized into its own directory.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a resource to learn and explore various machine learning algorithms through practical implementations. Whether you're new to machine learning or looking to refresh your knowledge, you'll find this repository helpful for understanding the core concepts behind each algorithm.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following machine-learning algorithms are currently implemented in this repository:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
4. Decision Trees
5. Random Forests
6. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
7. Naive Bayes
8. K-Means Clustering
9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
10. Neural Networks (Deep Learning):- Only basic ANN and CNN.
